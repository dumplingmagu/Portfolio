This repository will be my first attempt at organization using GitHub as well as a showing of my journey and growth as a developer. 
Goals... To have 5 projects completely with successful execution of application before any interviews.
        Build upon my knowledge in C++ in order to set myself up for success as a Game Dev. 
        Meet other people who can help to accelerate my growth and can benefit from the work ethic and quality that I will provide.
